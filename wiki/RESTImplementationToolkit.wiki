#Proposed list of features for a REST Programming Toolkit

= Introduction =
This article sets forth a list of features that should be present in any toolkit, library, and/or framework that supports REST.

= REST Implementation Toolkit =

The ease and fidelity of a REST-ful HTTP implementation depends, in part, on the quality of the programming tools at the developers disposal. This article identifies eight programming elements needed to support REST-ful HTTP implementations and why they are important. The author also provides examples of how these elements appear in common programming languages. 

Finally, several examples of patterns and anti-patterns in programming are reviewed with an eye toward the impact developer toolkits have in making it easier or more difficult to successfully build a REST-ful HTTP implementation.

_NOTE: Consider both client and server issues when describing these essential programming elements._

|| *Feature* || *Description* ||
|| Request Dispatcher || Routes HTTP requests to the proper execution code ||
||  URI Handler || Parses the details of the URI (scheme, path, query info, etc.) and exposes them for use. ||
|| Mime Parser || Handles the details of determining the media type including support for conneg ||
|| Request Handler || Target of the Request Dispatcher; the interesting/computational stuff goes here ||
|| Representation Handler || Converts stored data into the proper representation for responses and handles incoming representations from requests ||
|| HTTP Client || A 'mini HTTP Client' that allows you to make requests to, and handle responses from, other HTTP servers ||
|| Caching || Basic support for caching and conditional requests ||
|| Authentication || Understands various auth models (Basic, Digest, OAuth, etc. ||
